### 1. Fix PWA Service Worker and Manifest Paths

**Change Type**: fix

&gt; **Purpose**: To resolve the 404 errors preventing the Service Worker registration and manifest loading, enabling PWA installation and offline caching.
&gt; **Detailed Description**:
&gt; *   Corrected the paths used to reference `manifest.json` and `sw.js` in `routes/_app.tsx`. Changed `/static/manifest.json` to `/manifest.json` and `/static/sw.js` to `/sw.js`, aligning with how Fresh serves the `static` directory contents from the root.
&gt; *   Corrected the paths within the `urlsToCache` array in `static/sw.js`, removing the `/static` prefix (e.g., `/static/styles.css` became `/styles.css`).
&gt; *   Incremented the `CACHE_NAME` in `static/sw.js` to `v2` to ensure the updated Service Worker activates and clears the old cache.
&gt; **Reason for Change**: The previous paths (`/static/...`) were incorrect, leading to 404 errors and preventing PWA features from working as intended.
&gt; **Impact Scope**: Affects `routes/_app.tsx` (manifest link, SW registration path) and `static/sw.js` (cached URLs, cache version). Should fix PWA installation prompts and offline functionality.
&gt; **API Changes**: None.
&gt; **Configuration Changes**: None.
&gt; **Performance Impact**: Enables offline caching, potentially improving performance after the first visit.

   ```
   self-discipline-pwa
   - routes/
     - _app.tsx        // refact: Correct manifest and SW registration paths
   - static/
     - sw.js           // refact: Correct cached URLs, increment cache version
   ```

### 1. Implement PWA Features and Fix Theme Flicker

**Change Type**: feature/fix

&gt; **Purpose**: To enable Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities like offline access and installability, and to resolve the theme flashing issue during page navigation.
&gt; **Detailed Description**:
&gt; *   Created `static/manifest.json` to define PWA metadata (name, icons, start URL, display mode).
&gt; *   Created `static/sw.js` implementing a basic Service Worker with caching strategies (Network First for navigation, Cache First for static assets) to enable offline functionality.
&gt; *   Modified `routes/_app.tsx`:
&gt;     *   Added `<link rel="manifest" href="/static/manifest.json">` to the `<head>`.
&gt;     *   Added a script to register the Service Worker (`/static/sw.js`) on window load.
&gt;     *   Added an inline script in the `<head>` to apply the theme ('dark' class on `<html>`) directly from `localStorage` before the main component renders, preventing the flash of the default theme. Removed theme classes from `<body>` as they are now handled on `<html>`.
&gt; **Reason for Change**: Address user request for PWA features (offline access, installability) and fix the jarring theme flicker during navigation, improving user experience.
&gt; **Impact Scope**: Affects global application behavior (`_app.tsx`), introduces PWA core files (`manifest.json`, `sw.js`), and modifies how the theme is applied.
&gt; **API Changes**: None.
&gt; **Configuration Changes**: None.
&gt; **Performance Impact**: Adds Service Worker for caching, potentially improving load times after the first visit and enabling offline access. Inline theme script runs very early to prevent flicker.

   ```
   self-discipline-pwa
   - routes/
     - _app.tsx        // refact: Add manifest link, SW registration, inline theme script
   - static/
     - manifest.json   // add: PWA Web App Manifest
     - sw.js           // add: Service Worker script
   ```

### 1. Fix Global i18n and State Persistence Issues

**Change Type**: fix/refactor

&gt; **Purpose**: To resolve issues where language/theme settings were lost on page navigation and page titles were not being translated correctly.
&gt; **Detailed Description**:
&gt; *   Implemented full internationalization (i18n) support within all relevant Island components (`SleepForm`, `SleepList`, `ExerciseForm`, `ExerciseList`, `StudyForm`, `StudyList`, `SleepHeatmapSection`, `ExerciseHeatmapSection`, `StudyHeatmapSection`) using `SettingsContext`. Added necessary translation keys to context interface and locale files.
&gt; *   Resolved state persistence issue by refactoring `contexts/SettingsContext.tsx` to initialize state signals (`langSignal`, `themeSignal`) directly from `localStorage` at the module level (client-side), ensuring state is available before component render. Removed initialization logic from `SettingsProvider`'s `useEffect`. Added detailed logging for debugging.
&gt; *   Fixed page titles (`<h1>`) not updating on language change by creating a new Island component `islands/PageTitle.tsx` responsible for rendering translated titles using the context. Replaced static `<h1>` tags in all route files (`routes/*.tsx`) with this new Island component.
&gt; **Reason for Change**: Address user feedback regarding incomplete translation and state loss during navigation, likely due to timing issues between state initialization and component rendering in Fresh.
&gt; **Impact Scope**: Affects state management (`SettingsContext.tsx`), all Island components handling user-visible text, all page route components (`routes/*.tsx`), locale files, and introduces `islands/PageTitle.tsx`. Significantly improves i18n consistency and state persistence.
&gt; **API Changes**: None external. Internal context initialization logic changed.
&gt; **Configuration Changes**: None.
&gt; **Performance Impact**: Minimal. Initialization logic shifted. Added one small Island component.

   ```
   self-discipline-pwa
   - contexts/
     - SettingsContext.tsx // refact: Change state init logic, add logging

### 1. Add Navigation Icons to Header

**Change Type**: feature

> **Purpose**: To replace text-based navigation links in the header with icons for a cleaner look, as requested.
> **Detailed Description**:
> *   Created new SVG icon components in `components/icons/` for Home, Sleep, Exercise, and Study (`HomeIcon.tsx`, `SleepIcon.tsx`, `ExerciseIcon.tsx`, `StudyIcon.tsx`).
> *   Modified `components/Header.tsx` to import these new icons.
> *   Replaced the text links (`<a>{currentT.home}</a>`, etc.) with icon links (`<a><HomeIcon /></a>`, etc.).
> *   Added `title` attributes to the icon links to show text tooltips on hover (using translated text from context).
> *   Adjusted spacing in the header navigation area for icons.
> **Reason for Change**: User request to use icons instead of text for page navigation in the header.
> **Impact Scope**: Changes the appearance of the header navigation in `components/Header.tsx`. Introduces new icon components.
> **API Changes**: None.
> **Configuration Changes**: None.
> **Performance Impact**: Minimal, adds small SVG components.

   ```
   self-discipline-pwa
   - components/
     - Header.tsx // refact: Replace text nav links with icon components

### 1. Final Workaround for Header Rendering & Button Visibility

**Change Type**: fix/refactor

> **Purpose**: To ensure both the header background/styles and the settings buttons render correctly and reliably, resolving persistent conflicts.
> **Detailed Description**:
> *   Identified that rendering the `<header>` element (with Tailwind styles) and the `<SettingsManager>` Island together, regardless of whether in `_app.tsx` or a page route, caused unpredictable rendering failures (either header styles missing or buttons missing).
> *   Implemented a final workaround by completely separating the presentation header from the interactive buttons:
>     *   Restored `components/Header.tsx` to be a purely presentational component containing only the header structure, styles (`bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 shadow-md`), and title link. It no longer contains the `SettingsManager` Island.
>     *   Modified `routes/_app.tsx` to render both `<Header />` (for the visual bar) and `<SettingsManager />` (for the buttons) as direct children of `SettingsProvider`.
>     *   The `<SettingsManager />` Island is positioned absolutely in the top-right corner using Tailwind classes within a `div` wrapper in `_app.tsx`.
>     *   Removed the explicit rendering of `<Header />` from individual page routes (`index.tsx`, `sleep.tsx`, etc.) as it's now handled globally (but separately from buttons) in `_app.tsx`.
> **Reason for Change**: Exhausted all attempts to make the header styles and the Island co-exist reliably within the same parent element (`<header>`). Separating them structurally and using absolute positioning for the buttons is the most robust workaround for the suspected underlying Fresh/Tailwind/Hydration conflict.
> **Impact Scope**: Changes the layout structure in `_app.tsx` significantly. Simplifies `components/Header.tsx`. Removes Header rendering from page routes. Ensures both header visuals and button functionality are present.
> **API Changes**: None.
> **Configuration Changes**: None.
> **Performance Impact**: Minimal.

   ```
   self-discipline-pwa
   - components/
     - Header.tsx // refact: Remove SettingsManager, make purely presentational
   - routes/

### 1. Workaround for Header Rendering Issue

**Change Type**: fix/refactor

> **Purpose**: To ensure the global header renders correctly with its styles, bypassing a suspected conflict between `_app.tsx`, Islands, Context, and Tailwind CSS.
> **Detailed Description**:
> *   Identified that the `<header>` element defined in `routes/_app.tsx` failed to render with its Tailwind styles applied whenever the `SettingsManager` Island or `SettingsProvider` was present in the file, despite numerous debugging attempts on Context implementation and icon rendering.
> *   As a workaround, created a new component `components/Header.tsx` containing the original header structure and `<SettingsManager />`.
> *   Removed the `<header>` definition entirely from `routes/_app.tsx`, keeping only the `SettingsProvider` wrapping the main `<Component />`.
> *   Explicitly added the `<Header />` component to the top of each page route file (`routes/index.tsx`, `routes/sleep.tsx`, `routes/exercise.tsx`, `routes/study.tsx`).
> **Reason for Change**: Exhausted other debugging options for the header rendering failure in `_app.tsx`. Moving the header to individual pages avoids the problematic interaction within `_app.tsx`.
> **Impact Scope**: Changes the application's layout structure. `_app.tsx` is simplified. Header logic is now duplicated across page routes but rendered correctly. Affects all page route files and introduces `components/Header.tsx`.
> **API Changes**: None.
> **Configuration Changes**: None.
> **Performance Impact**: Minimal, slightly increases code size in page routes due to Header import/render.

   ```

### 1. Final Fix for Settings Context Reactivity

**Change Type**: fix

> **Purpose**: To ensure theme and language changes reliably update the UI across all components.
> **Detailed Description**:
> *   Reverted the Context implementation in `contexts/SettingsContext.tsx` back to providing Signal objects directly, instead of plain values. This ensures Preact's reactivity system correctly propagates updates from the Context Provider to consuming components (Islands and routes).
> *   Ensured all consuming components (`SettingsManager.tsx`, `routes/index.tsx`, Heatmap Sections) access the Signal values from the Context using the `.value` property.
> *   Confirmed that the previous switch to direct SVG components (instead of `@iconify/tailwind`) resolved the initial rendering issues with the `SettingsManager` Island.
> **Reason for Change**: The attempt to pass plain values through Context broke reactivity. Reverting to passing Signals fixed the issue where UI did not update upon state change.
> **Impact Scope**: Affects `SettingsContext.tsx` and all consuming components, restoring full functionality for theme and language switching.
> **API Changes**: None (internal implementation detail change).
> **Configuration Changes**: None (but `@iconify/tailwind` dependencies are now unused).
> **Performance Impact**: Negligible.

   ```
   self-discipline-pwa
   - contexts/
     - SettingsContext.tsx // refact: Revert to providing Signals in context
   - islands/
     - SettingsManager.tsx // refact: Access context Signals using .value

### 1. Fix Context API Implementation for Reactivity

**Change Type**: fix

> **Purpose**: To fix the issue where language and theme switching buttons stopped working after refactoring to Context API.
> **Detailed Description**:
> *   Identified that passing plain values instead of Signals through the Context broke the reactivity needed for components to update when the state changed.
> *   Reverted `contexts/SettingsContext.tsx` to provide Signal objects (`Signal<Lang>`, `Signal<Theme>`, `Signal<Translations>`) in the context value.
> *   Updated all consuming components (`SettingsManager.tsx`, `routes/index.tsx`, `islands/SleepHeatmapSection.tsx`, `islands/ExerciseHeatmapSection.tsx`, `islands/StudyHeatmapSection.tsx`) to correctly access the state values from the Context Signals using the `.value` property.
> **Reason for Change**: The previous attempt to pass plain values through Context was incorrect for maintaining reactivity with Preact Signals across component boundaries, especially with Islands. Passing the Signals themselves ensures components re-render when the signal values change.
> **Impact Scope**: Affects `SettingsContext.tsx` and all components consuming this context. Restores the intended reactive behavior.
> **API Changes**: Context value shape in `SettingsContextProps` reverted to using Signals.
> **Configuration Changes**: None.
> **Performance Impact**: Negligible, restores intended Signal-based reactivity.

   ```
   self-discipline-pwa
   - contexts/
     - SettingsContext.tsx // refact: Revert to providing Signals in context value
   - islands/

### 1. Refactor State Management to Context API & Fix Issues

**Change Type**: refactor/fix

> **Purpose**: To enable global language switching across components and resolve issues preventing the header/settings buttons from rendering correctly.
> **Detailed Description**:
> *   Identified that using `@iconify/tailwind` caused rendering issues with the `SettingsManager` Island. Switched to using direct SVG components (`LanguagesIcon`, `SunIcon`, `MoonIcon`) created in `components/icons/`.
> *   Identified that directly exporting/importing Signals between `SettingsManager` and `_app.tsx` caused issues.
> *   Implemented a React Context (`SettingsContext`) in `contexts/SettingsContext.tsx` to manage global state (language, theme, translations).
> *   The `SettingsProvider` now manages state internally using Signals but provides plain values and setter functions through the Context.
> *   Wrapped the application in `SettingsProvider` within `routes/_app.tsx`.
> *   Refactored `SettingsManager` Island to consume state and setters from `SettingsContext` instead of managing its own global state.
> *   Refactored `routes/index.tsx`, `islands/SleepHeatmapSection.tsx`, `islands/ExerciseHeatmapSection.tsx`, and `islands/StudyHeatmapSection.tsx` to consume the translation object `t` from `SettingsContext` for displaying localized text.
> *   Added new translation keys (`sleepHeatmapTitle`, etc.) to `locales/en.json` and `locales/zh.json`.
> *   Explicitly defined the `Translations` interface in `SettingsContext.tsx` to resolve TypeScript type inference issues.
> **Reason for Change**: Address user feedback that language changes weren't applying globally and fix rendering bugs related to icons and state management across Islands/SSR boundaries.
> **Impact Scope**: Major refactoring of state management for settings. Affects `_app.tsx`, `SettingsManager.tsx`, `index.tsx`, all Heatmap Section components, and introduces `SettingsContext.tsx` and SVG icon components. Removes the need for `@iconify/tailwind`.
> **API Changes**: `SettingsContext` introduced. Removed global exports from `SettingsManager`.
> **Configuration Changes**: (Future step: Remove `@iconify/tailwind` dependencies from `deno.json` and `tailwind.config.ts`).
> **Performance Impact**: Minimal change, replaces direct signal usage with Context consumption.

### 1. Implement Global Header, Icons, i18n, and Theme Switching

**Change Type**: feature

> **Purpose**: To enhance the application's usability and appearance by adding a global header, icon support, language switching (EN/ZH), and theme switching (Light/Dark).
> **Detailed Description**:
> *   Modified `routes/_app.tsx` to include a sticky header with the application title and placeholders for settings buttons.
> *   Added `@iconify/tailwind` and `@iconify-json/lucide` dependencies to `deno.json`.
> *   Configured `tailwind.config.ts` to use the `@iconify/tailwind` plugin for easy icon usage via classes (e.g., `i-lucide-languages`) and enabled class-based `darkMode`.
> *   Created `locales/en.json` and `locales/zh.json` for English and Chinese translations.
> *   Created the `islands/SettingsManager.tsx` component using Preact Signals to manage language and theme state, persist choices to `localStorage`, and update the UI accordingly (including `<html>` tag attributes/classes).
> *   Integrated `SettingsManager` into `_app.tsx`, replacing the placeholder buttons and using translated text for the title.
> **Reason for Change**: Address user request to make the application look more like a proper app with standard UI elements (buttons, icons), support Chinese language, and provide theme customization.
> **Impact Scope**: Affects global application layout (`_app.tsx`), styling configuration (`tailwind.config.ts`), dependencies (`deno.json`), and introduces new interactive elements (`SettingsManager.tsx`) and localization files (`locales/`).
> **API Changes**: None
> **Configuration Changes**: Modified `deno.json` (imports), `tailwind.config.ts` (plugins, darkMode).
> **Performance Impact**: Added client-side JavaScript for the `SettingsManager` island and its dependencies (Signals, Iconify). Added small JSON files for locales.

### 1. Update _app.tsx for basic layout and theme

**Change Type**: improvement

> **Purpose**: To establish a consistent base layout and implement automatic dark/light theme switching based on OS preference.
> **Detailed Description**: Modified `self-discipline-pwa/routes/_app.tsx` by adding Tailwind CSS classes to the `<body>` tag for background/text colors in light/dark modes (`bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-900 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100`) and adding color transition (`transition-colors duration-300`). Wrapped the main `<Component />` in a `<main>` tag with container styling (`container mx-auto p-4`).
> **Reason for Change**: Required for basic application structure and styling according to the development plan.
> **Impact Scope**: Affects the global layout and styling of all pages rendered within the app shell.
> **API Changes**: None
> **Configuration Changes**: None

### 2. Create Sleep Record Form component

**Change Type**: feature

> **Purpose**: To provide a user interface for logging sleep records.
> **Detailed Description**: Created the `SleepForm.tsx` island component in `self-discipline-pwa/islands/`. This component includes input fields for sleep time, wake time, and notes, performs basic validation, calculates duration, and currently logs the data to the console upon submission. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling and imports the existing `Button` component.
> **Reason for Change**: Core feature requirement for logging sleep data.
> **Impact Scope**: Introduces the first interactive form for data entry. Will later interact with data storage.
> **API Changes**: None
> **Configuration Changes**: None
> **Performance Impact**: Adds client-side JavaScript for the island's interactivity.

### 3. Fix Button import in SleepForm

**Change Type**: fix

> **Purpose**: To correct the import statement for the Button component in SleepForm.tsx.
> **Detailed Description**: Changed the import statement in `self-discipline-pwa/islands/SleepForm.tsx` from default import (`import Button from ...`) to named import (`import { Button } from ...`) to match the export style of `../components/Button.tsx`.
> **Reason for Change**: Resolve the "Module has no default export" error reported by Deno/TypeScript.
> **Impact Scope**: Affects only the `SleepForm.tsx` island.
> **API Changes**: None
> **Configuration Changes**: None
> **Performance Impact**: None

### 1. Create Sleep Page Route

**Change Type**: feature

> **Purpose**: To provide a dedicated page for the sleep logging form.

### 1. Create IndexedDB Service

**Change Type**: feature

> **Purpose**: To provide functions for interacting with the local IndexedDB database for storing records.
> **Detailed Description**: Created `self-discipline-pwa/services/db.ts`. This file sets up the IndexedDB database (`SelfDisciplineDB`) with object stores for sleep, exercise, and study records. It includes a `getDb` function for database initialization/connection and implements `addSleepRecord` and `getAllSleepRecords` functions. Placeholder functions for exercise and study records were also added. `addSleepRecord` now generates a UUID for the record ID.
> **Reason for Change**: Required for persisting user data locally within the browser.
> **Impact Scope**: Provides the core data persistence layer for the application. Will be used by form components and data display components.
> **API Changes**: None (internal service)
> **Configuration Changes**: None
> **Performance Impact**: Introduces asynchronous database operations.

### 2. Integrate IndexedDB saving into SleepForm

**Change Type**: feature

> **Purpose**: To save sleep records submitted via the SleepForm to the local IndexedDB database.
> **Detailed Description**: Modified `self-discipline-pwa/islands/SleepForm.tsx`. Imported `addSleepRecord` from `services/db.ts`. Updated the `handleSubmit` function to be `async` and call `await addSleepRecord()` within a `try...catch` block instead of logging to the console. Added an `isLoading` state to disable the form and show a loading indicator on the button during the save operation. Implemented basic error display if saving fails.
> **Reason for Change**: Complete the sleep logging feature by actually persisting the data.
> **Impact Scope**: Connects the UI form with the data persistence layer.
> **API Changes**: None
> **Configuration Changes**: None
> **Performance Impact**: Form submission now involves an asynchronous database write operation.
